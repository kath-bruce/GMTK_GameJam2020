WILL NEED TO PUT A DISCLAIMER ON THIS THAT IT'S NOT ACCURATE TO REAL LIFE COMPUTING!!!!!!!!!!!!!
	- human action - random human intervention, see ideas files
	- proper game state management
	- add to event log - which may need scripted scrolling but that should be easy enough
	- tutorial - click through slideshow - is start screen
	- restart
	- clean up
	- visuals
	- sound fx - on events, depending if good or bad
