TODO

challenge is in moving through the file system quickly, keeping on top of the infection 

- today

	- visual display of infection (white - unknown, purple - infected, green - clean, pink - contains infected (if folder))
		- scanning only goes one level deep
	- quarantine - timer based on antivirus strength
	- password - fills up as you find letters, random from pool
	- options for displaying dialog to human for help - consequences
	- licenses (upgrades) - show both anti virus and virus licenses
	- virus action - does something every 5 seconds? - relatively predictable but can mutate i.e., find licenses to gain speed, power (how many files it infects at once), break quarantined files quicker
	- human action - random human intervention, see ideas files
	- expand file system so there's a lot to explore - seed with licenses, jokes, password clues, dummy infected files, the virus itself
	- proper game state management
	- add to event log - which may need scripted scrolling but that should be easy enough
	- win by getting permission or license to quarantine virus or finding password

- tomorrow

	- tutorial - click through slideshow

	- clean up
	- visuals
	- sound fx - on events, depending if good or bad
