TODO

challenge is in moving through the file system quickly, keeping on top of the infection 

- today

	- visual display of infection (white - unknown, purple - infected, green - clean, pink - contains infected (if folder))
		- scanning only goes one level deep
	- scroll so selection is always in view
		- !!!!!!!!!!!!!! maybe only ever have one folder open in view (other than root)? scrolling just for event log expand
	- event log - can click to expand - virus can something say stuff - another scroll view
	- add action menu
		- scan file - puts something in event log and opens folder (so have open flag on folder and instantiate but disable that and every child if not open)
		- option to quarantine which takes time - more if infected - but wears off
		- if license, upgrade - unless need password which human user might need to reset password taking time
		- if missing letters, add letter to password
	- password - fills up as you find letters, random from pool
	- options for displaying dialog to human for help
	- licenses (upgrades)
	- timer display - how long it takes for you to win is your score
	- virus action timer display
	- virus action - does something every 5 seconds? - relatively predictable but can mutate i.e., find licenses to gain speed, power (how many files it infects at once), 
	- human action - random human intervention, see ideas files
	- expand file system so there's a lot to explore - seed with licenses, jokes, password clues, dummy infected files, the virus itself
	- proper game state management
