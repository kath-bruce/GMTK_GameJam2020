GMTK GAME JAM 2020 IDEAS

OUT OF CONTROL is the theme


maybe player is an antivirus program trying to stop a virus from taking over a computer?
	- virus was accidentally created by human user - password to disable it was taken from random files - can't delete because antivirus doesn't have admin privileges
	- every 10s, another file is infected - anti virus can get its own power ups from license keys - this is how it learns to defend itself from the antivirus - only a matter of time until it infects the root
	- a file can contain a clue or part of a password to disable the virus
	- maybe sometimes you can direct the human user to help - how much help they are is out of your control <<<THERE WE GO BINCHES
		-- sometimes the human user does odd things to try to help like restore from backup pc to when virus is less powerful but keeping antivirus strong, plugging in usb which takes attention of virus, running the antivirus as administrator at the cost of time, buy new upgrades (but may end up hindering - turn it off and on again therefore losing a turn, running another program taking away resources from the antivirus, deleting a file with a clue)
	- scattered are license keys that will give the antivirus power ups
	- different ways to kill the virus - put together the password to disable it, quarantine it, or somehow deleting it (if you can get the permission and know where the executable is)
	- movement is through a file directory (tree) - up/down to change selection, left to go up a folder, right to go into a folder, enter to open menu on what to do
	- quarantine it by finding where it is and use a quarantine function, if got the license
	- find the password to disable it by finding where it is and inspecting the files to find password and where the virus is
	
ABILITIES
	- quarantine folder - doesn't last forever
	- can scan a folder - instant
	- you can see where the infected files are - it's a challenge of navigating the file system to neutralise the infected files and getting to licenses
	to power up and defeat the virus
